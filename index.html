                <h2>New Dawn Fades</h2>
                <p>
                A change of speed, a change of style<br>
                A change of scene, with no regrets<br>
                A chance to watch, admire the distance<br>
                Still occupied, though you forget<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Different colors, different shades<br>
                Over each mistakes were made<br>
                I took the blame<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Directionless so plain to see<br>
                A loaded gun won't set you free<br>
                So you say<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                We'll share a drink and step outside<br>
                An angry voice and one who cried<br>
                'We'll give you everything and more<br>
                The strain is too much, can't take much more<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire<br>
                Can't seem to feel it anymore<br>
                It was me, waiting for me<br>
                Hoping for something more<br>
                Me, seeing me this time<br>
                Hoping for something else<br>
                </p>
